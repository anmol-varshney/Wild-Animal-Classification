# 🐅 Classifying CHEETAH, HYENA, JAGUAR AND TIGER Using Convolutional Neural Network
To perform the task with an ease, a pre-trained neural network is used with the pretrained parameters i.e. VGG19. The Convolutional Neural Network is built to classify various breeds of Cheetah as in this scenario, the network is organized with some layers and normalizers to classify the images(present in Cheetah, Hyena, Jaguar and Tiger dataset) into their specified classes as Cheetah, Hyena, Jaguar and Tiger. VGG19 is used to attain better results with highly trained parameters and dense network which is a perfect arrangement of Max pooling layers and Convolutional layers.
#### About Dataset
Image dataset: cheetahs, jaguars, hyenas, and tigers. All images size is 400(H) * 400(W) * 3(RGB). In each class include, 900 training images and 100 validation images are provided.

Each label of an image is specified in the image name. and its folder name Therefore, you can use the image name to create classification ground truth. Totally, 4K labeled images are provided for the training dataset
